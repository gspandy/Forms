Forms aims to provide the developer with easier ways to create Vaadin Form objects and more control over the layout of the form.

Currently, this add-on only provides a single implementation named GridForm.  This object is a Vaadin Form using a GridLayout to lay
out the components.  While a Vaadin Form can use a GridLayout already, there is no support for actually telling the form where to
place the components nor is there the ability to have components span multiple rows and columns.  GridForm attempts to solve this
problem.
